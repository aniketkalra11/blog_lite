// Time based backend user management
//TODO: I will maintain per user active time on daily basis
//


// Internally store most recent public post details on the
// server and keep updating when ever a new post being added
// while intializing the server compute most recent public posts
// and store then in time based management system.

// I will assume user is active if logined and inactive if 
// user didn't do any activity within 10mins.

And regarding analysis of post creation. I think, we don't need to maintain a seprate table for that
because we can run through all the posts which are available and plot the graph accordingly 
because this is a small scale application we can assume that it will not exceed much if exceeds then we will move to new approach
for most active user time I can store every user details in the file system where i can write every user past 10 login times for book  keepings. and analys the user behaviour accordingly.
for ACTIVE USER RECORD I SELECTED FILE SYSTEM BASED DATABASE DESIGN.
we will check more security features later on.

// Now i need to think about likes and bookmarks in this case.
I need to create api to get the post list
verify token is working or not.
get post complete details,
and simple post details.
